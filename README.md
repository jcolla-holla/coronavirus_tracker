## Background

Coronavirus reverberates through news cycles around the world, with varying levels of concern from utter hysteria to total indifference.  The goal of this project, Coronavirus Tracker, is to provide a data-centric, interactive overview of the coronavirus spread to counter narratives that are not based in fact/numbers.

## Data Source

A challenge given the extremely fluid global situation surrounding coronavirus (not to mention the possibility that some government reporting agencies may not be completely truthful in their statistics reporting), is finding a trustworthy data source that is frequently updated and acceessible (for free) via API.  Luckily, researchers at Johns Hopkins University have quickly created exactly that!  Note: if you are aware of other or better API sources for similar information, please get in contact with me.

## Existing Similar Solutions

There are some existing sites that serve a similar function, listed below.  However, none of the websites that I found provide a robust data interactivity capability that might be useful to a user asking questions like: "are there reported cases near my home city/state/country?".  Nor do they provide some kind of alert mechanism for if confirmed cases are reported near their location.  Coronavirus Tracker aims to address these two questions.
